            <p>I'm very very grateful to Newton School for teaching me and helping me acquire the skills in just a
                period of 5 months and bringing lots of companies for placement without even getting 1â‚¹ until I got the
                first salary which was made possible by them in just a month after I completed the course.</p>

                I started the course with some elementary knowledge but
                got introduced to many new topics like stack, queues, and hashmap
                trees which I had never had a chance to learn before. My familiarity
                with them now will definitely help in the future now. Overall, I had a great
                experience with Newton School and would recommend it to anyone looking to learn Full Stack Development.

            <p>A note of thanks to Newton School
                I joined Newton in January 2021, when a friend of mine who also got placed from Newton told me about the
                course. The course completed 6 months later. The course was well structured and well paced. Mentor
                sessions were held regularly and immensely helpful. The course completed on time and during placements
                there were a lot of companies to apply and choose from</p>

                I had no idea of ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, Express and JavaScript. I had basic DSA knowledge to begin
                with.
                The course was a 6 month long bootcamp and yes its obvious that you are expected to work hard for it.
                The first half was focused on Data Structures and Algorithms and the second half on Web Development.

                Newton delivered every bit of what it promised.

                I am forever indebted and eternally grateful to Newton School for believing in me as well as guiding me
                like an elder brother. I literally had no money to pay upfront and the opportunity to learn for free and
                pay only after placement was exactly what I needed. </p>
